CS-210 
Airgead Banking Project

#1 - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was about getting values from a user and then showing the user how their balance will look depending on what values they entered. The program then allows the user to make changes to their monthly deposits, annual interest and number of years until they see what works best for them.

#2 - What did you do particularly well? 
I feel the way I structured my code made it easy to understand and read. Compared to other programs I have done I think this one looks the best. 

#3 - Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I should have done more testing to improve my output. More specifically user input validation for when a user enters a character or string instead of an integer. As it is now it will let them know it is invalid, but it will keep looping. If I had caught this, I would have made changes to my code, and it would have run a lot better.

#4 - Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? One thing I had a hard time with is getting the spacing right depending on what values were entered. Getting the right values in setw, fixed, and setpercision took me a while. I decided to look at lots of YouTube videos and got on with a tutor at one point. I was finally given advice to use if, else if and else for different values and set up setw and setpercision accordingly. YouTube has been a big help to me as I can see different examples and approaches to help me better understand what I need to do. I will continue to use YouTube and the 24/7 tutor to help me overcome challenges. 

#5 - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
Being able to create classes and use different files I think will benefit me in the future. I think using a class helped me to organize my code and getting information from different files helped me separate certain things and made it easier to call them.
#6 - How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Making sure I used functions and files helped me to properly structure and maintain my code. That also helped in ensuring that my code was readable and adaptable. Also keeping in mind, the guidelines and rubric for this project was important as I kept making sure that I was doing what was expected of me. Taking the advice that Mr. Foster gave us and incorporating that into my code also helped me in making sure I did what was needed for his project.
